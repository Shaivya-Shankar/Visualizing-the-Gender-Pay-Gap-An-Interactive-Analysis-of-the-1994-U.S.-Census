## Project Overview

This repository contains the code and analysis for a deep dive into the factors driving gender-based income disparity, using the 1994 U.S. Census "Adult" dataset. The project's goal was to preprocess a complex, real-world dataset, build an interactive dashboard to explore the nuances of the pay gap, and apply advanced dimensionality reduction techniques to uncover hidden structures in the data. The analysis confirms a persistent pay gap and identifies the private sector as the area with the most significant income disparity between genders.
